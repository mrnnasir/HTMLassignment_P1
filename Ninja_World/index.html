      <h3 class="subtitle">Origins in Feudal Japan</h3>
      <p class="description">The history of ninja, or shinobi, traces back to Japan’s turbulent feudal era around the 15th century. During this time of constant warfare, samurai clans and warlords sought alternative methods of intelligence gathering and combat. Unlike the highly codified samurai, ninja relied on stealth, deception, and unconventional tactics. Their skills developed as practical responses to survival in a chaotic and divided Japan.</p>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Training and Skills</h3>
      <p class="description">Ninja were trained in a discipline known as ninjutsu, which emphasized espionage, disguise, survival skills, and guerrilla warfare. They mastered techniques such as silent movement, infiltration, and the use of specialized tools and weapons like shuriken (throwing stars) and kusarigama (sickle with chain). Unlike popular myths, ninja were not magical warriors but resourceful operatives blending strategy, psychology, and physical skill.</p>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Role in Warfare</h3>
      <p class="description">Ninja played a vital role as spies, scouts, and saboteurs during the Sengoku period (1467–1615), when rival warlords constantly battled for power. Clans such as the Iga and Kōga became renowned for their shinobi traditions, offering their services to powerful daimyō (lords). They disrupted enemy supply lines, gathered intelligence, and sometimes engaged in targeted assassinations, giving them an important—if shadowy—place in military strategy.</p>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Decline and Transformation</h3>
      <p class="description">With the unification of Japan under the Tokugawa shogunate in the early 17th century, the constant warfare that fueled ninja activity subsided. The shogunate’s strict peace left little demand for covert operatives, and ninjutsu gradually declined as a practiced profession. However, elements of ninja training were preserved in martial arts traditions and folklore, keeping their image alive even as their real-world role diminished.</p>

      <h3 class="subtitle">Legacy and Popular Culture</h3>
      <p class="description">Today, the legacy of the ninja is far larger than their historical footprint. From kabuki theater and Edo-period tales to modern films, anime, and video games, ninja have been mythologized into figures of near-supernatural ability. While historians emphasize their practical role as spies and irregular warriors, global popular culture celebrates them as mysterious, masked warriors of the night, ensuring that the image of the ninja endures well beyond feudal Japan.</p>
